I am a student that is learning the basics of CSS. I need to create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by the botanical San Francisco garden in the art style of Mucha. I need styling for these sections: navigation, header section, about me, education, projects, contact form.
I would like the website to have colors similar to 90s romantic comedy posters. Specifically movies like My Best Friend's Wedding, 13 going on 30, and Practical Magic. I want the layout to be universal for both mobile and desktop. Please break down the different parts of CSS and explain what it does. 
The color scheme must be whimsical and pastel. 
I want the font to be similar to Vogue's. 
Hover effects on buttons and links, in pink.
I want the spacing to have the contents in the middle of the page. 
This is the file I am working with.
