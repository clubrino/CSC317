## Overview

For our groupâ€™s final project, *After the Credits*, my role was the **Frontend Lead**. This role gave me the opportunity to develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive layout design. It has also allowed me to understand how to work in a group and collaberat everyone's contribution into workflow.

## Contributions

As the Frontend Lead, I was responsible for  designing the layout and page structure. I made sure that the web layout was resposnive to the backend structure. The styling reflects towards a modern user experience. It was interesting on understanding the use of views and routes. How it allowed me to understand the structure and layout of the components.

## Challenges

The challenges of this assignment was developing that understanding of what a Frontend Lead was. Since this is my first time creating a platform with a database, I had trouble udnerstanding how the structure connected with the backend made it work. I think I would have to keep creating and building projects to become more familiar with these tasks.

## Reflection

This project was really fun. I really appreciate the integration of the database and understanding structure. It has opened more oppurtunities in creation and ways to improve the way I work. It has also helped me recognize areas of improvement in working with otheres and communication.
