## Reflection
The difference in the handwritten and ai files is that although AI makes it possible to achieve
a more polished look, it is not as organized as the handwritten CSS. The handwritten CSS is more
organized and easier to read. Sometimes the AI doesn't meet the aesthetic that the designer is going for.
The handwritten CSS is more flexible and can be easily adjusted. In the hybdrid version, I tried to combine
the two files. By doing so, I was able to pick which elements would meet the aesthetic I was looking for. However,
I much prefer the handwritten and hybrid veresions.
