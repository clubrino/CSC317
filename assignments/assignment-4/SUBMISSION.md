## Portfolio Styling Assignment: Human vs. AI CSS Challenge

## Analysis
The difference in the handwritten and ai files is that although AI makes it possible to achieve
a more polished look, it is not as organized as the handwritten CSS. The handwritten CSS is more
organized and easier to read. Sometimes the AI doesn't meet the aesthetic that the designer is going for.
The handwritten CSS is more flexible and can be easily adjusted. In the hybdrid version, I tried to combine
the two files. By doing so, I was able to pick which elements would meet the aesthetic I was looking for. However,
I much prefer the handwritten and hybrid veresions.

## Lessons Learned
In this excercise, I learned how to create CSS in a more organized way. I was able to
understand use of selectors and how to apply them to the HTML. I also learned how to use the Box Model and
FlexBox&Grid to create a responsive layout. This allowed met create a portfolio that is easily to adjust through
CSS. I can easily go through my layout and change the size of certain elements.

## Preferred Version
I prefer ai-2.css. The format of the CSS is more organized and easy to read. It also 
matched the aesthetic that I was going for. In comparison to ai-1.css, I thinke the use
of pictures allowed the CSS to be more visually appealing. I tried to combine the two into the
hybrid version. I appreciate the polished look of it now, where it is minimal and clean.
