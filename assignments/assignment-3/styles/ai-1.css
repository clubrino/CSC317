/* 
Prompt: 
I want to create a CSS file that has colors that represent the luxury perfume band Diptyque, the typography similar to Dior,
and the layout like how apple.com presents their products. I would also like to add one transition effect when moving to the next section.

Here’s a CSS file that aligns with your vision:

Colors inspired by Diptyque (elegant, neutral, and sophisticated tones: black, white, soft gold, and muted beige).
Typography similar to Dior (high-end, serif fonts like "Playfair Display" or "Didot").
Apple-like layout (clean, full-width sections with strong imagery and generous whitespace).
Smooth transition effect (fade-in effect when scrolling to the next section).
I'll generate the CSS file for you.
/* Luxury Perfume-Inspired Styles */
/* Importing a serif font similar to Dior */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;700&display=swap');

:root {
    --primary-bg: #f5f3ee; /* Soft beige */
    --primary-text: #1a1a1a; /* Deep black */
    --accent: #d4af37; /* Soft gold */
    --border-color: #e0ddd5; /* Subtle grayish-beige */
    --transition-time: 0.8s;
}

body {
    font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
    background-color: var(--primary-bg);
    color: var(--primary-text);
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, h3 {
    font-weight: 700;
}

/* Apple-style layout: full-width sections */
.section {
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
}

/* Smooth fade-in transition when scrolling */
.fade-in {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
    transition: opacity var(--transition-time) ease-out, transform var(--transition-time) ease-out;
}

    .fade-in.visible {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }

/* Button styling with gold accents */
.button {
    background-color: var(--accent);
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    font-size: 18px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

    .button:hover {
        background-color: #b98e1b;
    }

/* Adding smooth scrolling effect */
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* JavaScript will be required to add the visible class when scrolling */
This CSS file achieves the luxury aesthetic you're looking for by incorporating Diptyque's color palette, Dior-inspired typography, and an Apple-like layout.

Key Features:
Elegant serif typography similar to Dior.
Diptyque's soft beige, black, and gold as the color scheme.
Apple-like layout with full-width sections.
Smooth fade-in effect when scrolling to a new section.
For the fade-in effect to work, you’ll need to add a bit of JavaScript to detect scrolling and apply the .visible class dynamically. Would you like me to provide that script as well?
